A **100% free, high-performance RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** chatbot that intelligently answers questions about any uploaded PDF document.

This project uses a cost-effective **hybrid architecture**, combining the power of the **free-tier Google Gemini API** for reasoning and the efficiency of **free Hugging Face models** for embeddings.  
Built entirely with **LangChain** and deployed live on **Streamlit Cloud**.

## 🧠 Overview

This project was born from an *“Edison experiment”* — to build a **smart, reliable, and cost-free document chatbot**.

The main challenge: navigating the complex world of GenAI APIs — from billing (OpenAI/Google embeddings) and resource limits (Mistral 7B RAM crash on Colab) to dependency chaos (`langchain.chains` errors).

The **solution**: a **robust Hybrid RAG system** that strategically uses the best *free tools* for each stage of the process.

## ✨ Key Features

- 💬 **Chat with Any PDF:** Upload a syllabus, technical manual, or research paper — get instant, context-aware answers.  
- 🧭 **Intelligent & Honest:** The bot finds exact answers; if it’s not in the PDF, it’ll tell you.  
- 💸 **100% Free Architecture:**
  - Free **HuggingFace embeddings** for vectorization  
  - Free-tier **Gemini 2.5 Flash API** for response generation  
- 🧩 **Handles Complex PDFs:** Uses `PyPDFLoader` to extract text and tables efficiently (fixed in **v19!**)  
- 🌐 **Live & Deployed:** Fully containerized and hosted on Streamlit Cloud

## ⚙️ How It Works: Hybrid RAG Architecture

Here’s what happens when you ask a question 👇

1. **UI & Upload (Streamlit):** You upload a PDF via the Streamlit interface.

2. **Load & Split (PyPDFLoader):** The PDF is securely loaded and split into small, indexed chunks.

3. **Embed (HuggingFace - FREE):** Each chunk is turned into a numerical vector using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

4. **Store (FAISS):** These vectors are stored in-memory with **FAISS**, forming the “brain” of the PDF.

5. **Retrieve (LangChain):** LangChain retrieves the most relevant chunks based on your question.

6. **Generate (Gemini - FREE):** The system sends your question + relevant chunks to **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, which generates the final answer.

7. **Answer:** A smart, accurate response appears instantly in the chat UI.
